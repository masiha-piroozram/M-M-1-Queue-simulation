# M-M-1-Queue-simulation
This code simulate a simple M/M/1 queue. All you need to do is to run the "M/M/1.py" file. Afterward two CSV files will be generated. One is a timeline of all the events and the other provide information about each customer. You can also adjust the number of customers, arrival rate and serving rate in the code. The comments written in the code can guide you.  
The Queueing Simulation.csv contain following information:  
• arrival time of a customer  
• exit time of a customer  
• duration time that a customer was being served  
• waiting time of a customer  
• total time of a customer being in the system  
• times between customer arrivals  
And the Timeline.csv also contain following information:  
• arrival times  
• exit times  
• number of event happend in a speific time  
• total number of customers existing in the system at a time  
• times between events  
You can also run the "M/M/1 with package.R" to see and compare the result using Queueing Package in R.  
There is also a zip file named "Example.zip" which you can see how the result should be on your device. In case of any contradiction, you can contact me.
